### Project Description
- Solve part of a business task and try on the role of an analyst at HeadHunter.


### What Case Are We Solving?
- We need to build a model that automatically determines an approximate salary level suitable for a user based on the information they provided about themselves.

**Problem**
- Some job seekers do not specify their desired salary when creating a resume.
This creates difficulties for HeadHunter’s recommendation system, which matches job seekers with the most suitable vacancies and employers with the most suitable candidates.

**Quality Metric**
....

**What We Practice**
- Applying learned material: variables, basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets), loops, functions, and libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
