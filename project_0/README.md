### What case are we solving?
We need to write a program that guesses a number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. By "guess", we mean "write a program that guesses the number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the random number is greater or less than what we need.

**Quality metrics**  
Results are assessed by the average number of attempts out of 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**  
Learning to write good code in Python.
