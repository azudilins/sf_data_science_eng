### Project Description
Guess the number guessed by the computer in the minimum number of attempts.

### What case are we solving?
We need to write a program that guesses a number in the minimum number of attempts.

**Competition conditions:**
- The computer thinks of a number from 0 to 100, and we have to guess it. By "guess", we mean "write a program that guesses the number".
- The algorithm takes into account information about whether the entered number is greater or less than what we need.
- It is necessary to ensure that the program guesses the number in less than 20 attempts.

**Quality metrics**  
Results are assessed by the average number of attempts out of 1000 repetitions.

**What we practice**
- Learning to write good code in Python.
- Learning to work with IDE.
- Learning to work with GitHub.

### Brief information about the data

### Stages of work on the project

### Result  
Algorithm guesses the number on average in 5 attempts.

### Conclusions
- The algorithm has been implemented and the solution has been posted in the GitHub repository.
- The number of attempts has been correctly taken into account, and the minimum possible average value for the given range has been achieved.
- There are docstrings for functions and comments, the code complies with pep-8 requirements.
- Dependencies are recorded in the corresponding requirements.txt files.
- The project description is presented in the README.md file.
